DOCKER:

1.Docker containers are the fastest growing cloud-enabling technology and driving a new era of computing and application architecture with 
  their lightweight approach to bundle applications and dependencies into isolated, yet highly portable application packages.
  
2.Containers alone are not enough to provide value at the scale of your enterprise and do not directly address the compliance, security and
  operational needs of your organization.
  
3.Docker is your partner for digital and cloud initiatives and we have an enterprise-ready container platform that harnesses
  the potential of containers and a methodology that puts you at the center of the journey - no matter where you are today. 
  
4.Docker-led transformation works with the people, process and technology you have today, integrates to it, and evolves it at the pace your
  business needs.
