DDOS: Distributed Denial of Service

DDoS is short for Distributed Denial of Service. DDoS is a type of DOS attack where multiple compromised systems, which are often infected
with a Trojan, are used to target a single system causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Victims of a DDoS attack consist of both the
end targeted system and all systems maliciously used and controlled by the hacker in the distributed attack.

How DDoS Attacks Work?

In a DDoS attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources – potentially hundreds of thousands or
more. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single IP address; plus, it is very difficult to 
distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin.

The Difference Between DoS and DDos Attacks:

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is different from a DDoS attack. The DoS attack typically uses one computer and one Internet connection 
to flood a targeted system or resource. The DDoS attack uses multiple computers and Internet connections to flood the targeted resource.
DDoS attacks are often global attacks, distributed via botnets.

Types of DDoS Attacks:

There are many types of DDoS attacks. Common attacks include the following:

Traffic attacks: Traffic flooding attacks send a huge volume of TCP, UDP and ICPM packets to the target. 
                 Legitimate requests get lost and these attacks may be accompanied by malware exploitation.
Bandwidth attacks: This DDos attack overloads the target with massive amounts of junk data. This results in a loss of network bandwidth
                   and equipment resources and can lead to a complete denial of service.
Application attacks: Application-layer data messages can deplete resources in the application layer, leaving the target's system services 
                     unavailable.
                    
FAMOUS EXAMPLES OF DDOS ATTACKS:

Kevin Poulsen vs. KISS-FM: 

Kevin was teenage telephone hacker back in 1990 when this incident occurred. He jammed all the telephone lines 
so that only he could be the 102nd winning caller at the KISS-FM of Los Angeles. The winning prize was a Porsche. In the ensuing months he
tapped into Hollywood actresses, the FBI as well as the Army. He was sentenced to 51 months in prison, banned from touching a computer for
 3 years and was fined as well. Today he works as a journalist.
 
Adrian Lamo vs. The New York Times: 

In 2002 Adrian hacked into The New York Times server and searched himself on Nexis Lexis the cost of each search was $300000 incurred by 
the company. He was sentenced to 15 years in jail as it was federal crime.

Mafiaboy vs. CNN, Dell, Yahoo, eBay and Amazon:

In February, 2000 15 year old Michal Calce was responsible for launching a major DDOS attack that crippled some of internet most famous
websites. He crippled the search engine Yahoo of the time and went on to batter the servers of the remaining sites. This he did to make
a name for himself. He was sent to a juvenile detention centre although he faced 3 years in prison.

David L. Smith vs. Microsoft Word and Excel: 

The man used a stolen American online account to spread a virus that was named after a sipperars name. The virus spread
onto 50 accounts through email and jammed servers. In the end â€œMelissaâ€ gave viral lap dances to 50 million accounts that resulted 
in a loss of $80 million.
